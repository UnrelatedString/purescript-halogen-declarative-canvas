package:
  name: declarative-canvas
  description: A simple wrapper around halogen-canvas which provides component input as the primary driver for drawing, allowing incorporation of the canvas into the declarative UI of a web page without manually updating it through queries. # ...except halogen-canvas is completely unlicensed so I have no idea if I can even legally use it considering bundled JS is effectively static linking... And like also I feel like it still exposes a "more raw" Canvas API than is actually nice to work with
